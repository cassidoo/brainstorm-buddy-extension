# Brainstorming buddy extension for GitHub Copilot

This extension is a GitHub Copilot extension that helps you brainstorm ideas for your projects!

It is based on [Brainstory](https://github.com/brainstory), but fully built into GitHub Copilot.

## Usage

After installing the extension, open up GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code.

You can mention the extension with `@brainstorm-buddy-extension` and start typing, or, for a more fluid experience, you can click the microphone button and verbally speak to it.

### Suggested conversation flow/tips

- Start by telling the extension about your project and what you're trying to do. You could say, "I have an idea for a talk I want to give, and I know I want to touch on [some topic], but I'm not sure what else to include." Or, "I want to build a new app that does [some thing], but I'm not sure where to start."
- The extension is designed to **not give you answers** but to help you think through your ideas and come up with new ones. It will ask you questions to help you think through your ideas.
- You can say things like, "scratch that, I want to start over," or "pretend I didn't say that last part. Let's talk about something else." and it will adapt.
- The more context you give the extension, the better it will be able to help you. Let yourself talk it out as if you're "rubber duck debugging" your ideas.
- Again, you can type or text, but chances are your ideas will flow better if you use the microphone.
